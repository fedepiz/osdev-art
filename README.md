Beauty is in the eye of the beholder

OSDev art is my attempt at a putting togheter decently complete x86-only Operative System. By decently complete,  I mean it should  support features in all the major dimension which an OS is supposed to take care of - but in a simplified and minimalistic way, as this is mostly meant as a fun self-learning long term exercise. For example, multitasking is in, but parallel execution on multiple is not planned.
